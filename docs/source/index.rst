pyMPM documentation
===================

**pyMPM** is a python implementation of the mutual polarization method (MPM) developed by Dr. Zachary Sherman for calculating the dipole response of an ensemble of plasmonic resonators to an external electro-magnetic stimuli under the electrostatic approximation.
It also includes a few tools for calculating near- and far-field spectra of the media.
